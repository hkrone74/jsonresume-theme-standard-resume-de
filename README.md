### Install the command line

We're going to use the official [resume-cli](https://github.com/jsonresume/resume-cli) to run our development server.

Go ahead and install it:

```bash
npm install -g resume-cli
```

### Download theme

```bash
npm install -g jsonresume-theme-standard-resume
```

### Serve theme

While inside the theme folder, simply run:

```
resume serve -t standard-resume
```

You should now see this message:

```
Preview: http://localhost:4000
Press ctrl-c to stop
```

Congratulations, you've made it!
